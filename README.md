Learnings and Challenges:

This project provided me with hands-on experience in building a responsive and visually appealing web page, closely mirroring the design and layout of the original Amazon website. Some key learnings and challenges included:

Mastering CSS layout techniques such as flexbox and positioning to accurately replicate the intricate layout and positioning of various elements on the page.
Employing responsive design principles and media queries to ensure a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.
Paying attention to detail and ensuring pixel-perfect representation of the original Amazon homepage design.
Future Improvements
